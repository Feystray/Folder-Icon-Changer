# Folder Icon Changer Windows

It my another useless project. 
I like setting icon of my folder to distinguish.

I made this app to decorate folder of installtion directory of apps.
Steps:
1. Simply copy the the exe file(Use admin exe file to chnage the icon of system folder and normal for any other directory) to the installed app directory and run the exe file. 
2. It will ask the file whose icon you want to set.
3. Enter the number in front of it.

   It will set the icon of the folder.
   I know we can set the icon via folder options but I thought it is the easy way.
